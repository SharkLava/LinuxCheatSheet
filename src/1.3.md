# Basic Programming

## Variables
 `<data_type>` `<var_name>` = `<value>`
- Variables are names given to computer memory locations in order to store data and access it throughout a program.
- We can think of them as containers of data.
- Each variable in C has an associated data type, which tells us what kind of information the variable can hold. 
- Each data type requires different amounts of memory.
- Format specifiers are used in input and output to tell the compiler what kind of data is being handled.

|Data Type|Memory(Bytes)|Format Specifier|Example|
|:------|:----|:------|:-----|
|char|1|%c|char c = 'a';|
|int|4|%d|int i = 0;|
|float|4|%f|float f = 9.19;|
|short|2|%hd|short s = 5;|
|long|4|%ld|long l = 123456789;|
|double|8|%lf|double pi =  3.14159265358979323846;|

- To calculate the range of a data type:
  - Calculate the number of bits it can hold.
    - 1 byte = 8 bits
  - For an `unsigned`  data type, the range is 0 to 2<sup>n</sup>-1 where n is the number of bits it can hold.
  - For a `signed` data type, the range is -2<sup>n</sup> to 2<sup>n</sup>-1 where n is the number of bits it can hold divided by 2.

## Operators

### Arithmetic Operators
Let A = 10 and B = 20.
|Operator|Description|Example|
|:------:|:------|:-----|
|+|Adds two operands.|A + B = 30|
|-|Subtracts second operand from the first.|A − B = -10|
|\*|Multiplies both operands.|A * B = 200|
|/|Divides numerator by de-numerator.|B / A = 2|
|%|Modulus Operator gives the remainder after integer division.|B % A = 0|
|++|Increment operator increases the integer value by one.|A++ = 11|
|--|Decrement operator decreases the integer value by one.|A-- = 9|

### Relational Operators
Let A = 10 and B = 20.
|Operator|Description|Example|
|:------:|:------|:-----|
|==|Checks if the values of two operands are equal.|(A == B) is false.|
|!=|Checks if the values of two operands are not equal.|(A != B) is true.|
|> and <|Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than or less than the right operand respectively.|((A > B) is false.|
|>= and <=|Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to or less than or equal to the value of right operand respectively.|(A <= B) is true.|

### Logical Operators
Let A = 1 and B = 0.
|Operator|Description|Example|
|:------:|:------|:-----|
|&&|Logical AND Operator checks if both the operands are non-zero.|(A && B) is false.|
|\|\||Logical OR Operator checks if either of the operands are non-zero.|(A \|\| B) is true.|
|!|Logical NOT Operator checks is used to reverse the logical state of its operand.|!(A && B) is true.|

### Assignment Operators
|Operator|Description|Example|
|:------:|:------|:-----|
|=|Assigns values from right side operands to left side operand.|C = A + B will assign the value of A + B to C|
|+=, -=, \*=, /=, %=|Performs the operation with the left operand as the first and the right operand as the second and assigns the result to the left operand.|C /= A is equivalent to C = C / A|

### Bitwise Operators
- These work on bits and perform bit-by-bit operations.

Let A = 60 and B = 13.
|Operator|Description|Example|
|:------:|:------|:-----|
|&|Binary AND Operator copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands. |(A & B) = 12, i.e., 0000 1100|
|\||Binary OR Operator copies a bit if it exists in either operand.|(A \| B) = 61, i.e., 0011 1101|
|^|Binary XOR Operator copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both. |(A ^ B) = 49, i.e., 0011 0001|

### Miscellaneous Operators
|Operator|Description|Example|
|:------:|:------|:-----|
|sizeof()|Returns the size of a variable.|sizeof(a), where a is integer, will return 4.|
|(Condition)? X : Y|Ternary Operator or Conditional Expression.|If condition is true ? then value X : otherwise value Y|

## Basic Headers
```#include <filename.h>```
- C has numerous libraries that include predefined functions to make programming easier, which are accessible through header files.
- We request to use a header file, which usually has a '.h' extension, by importing it with the C preprocessing directive `#include`.
### include <stdio.h>
- This header is used to access standard input and output functions.
### include <stdlib.h>
- This header is used to access memory allocation and freeing functions.

## Functions
 ```
 return-type function-name( parameter list ) {
   // body of the function
}
```
- A function is a group of statements that perform a task.
#### Return Type
  - It is the data type of the value the function returns.
  - The return type is *void* if the function doesn't return a value.
#### Function Name
  - It is the name of the function.
#### Parameters
  - These are placeholders for the values that are passed to the function.
  - A function may have no parameters.
#### Body
  - It is a collection of statements that define what the function does.

The function name and parameters constitute the *function signature*.
### scanf(format-string[...,arguments,...]);
- This function is used to get the input from the user.
### printf(format-string[...,arguments,...]);
- This function is used to print a statement.

## Comments
- // Single Line Comments

- /* Multi 
Line
Comments */

## Conditional Statements
- These are used to make decisions based on the conditions specified, which may change the execution flow.
```c
if (condition1) {
// block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
// block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
// block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
} 
```

### If Statement
- Use this statement to specify a block of C code to be executed if a condition is `true`.

### Else Statement
- Use this statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is `false`.

### Else If Statement
- Use this statement to specify a new condition if the `first condition` is `false`.

## Loops
- These can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is satisfied.

### Entry Controlled Loops
#### For Loop
- It is used when you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code.
```C
 for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```
- Statement 1
  - Is executed once before the execution of the code block to `initialize` the counter variable.
- Statement 2
  - Defines the `condition` for executing the code block.
- Statement 3
  - Is executed every time after the code block has been executed to `update` the counter variable.

#### While Loop
- It loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
```C
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```
### Exit Controlled Loops
#### Do-While Loop
- This loop will execute the code block once before checking if the condition is true.
- It will then repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.
```C
do {
  // code block to be executed
}
while (condition);
```
## Arrays
```dataType arrayName[arraySize];```
- It is a data structure of fixed size that can store a sequential collection of elements of the same data type.
- Multiple variables are grouped under single name with individual elements accessed using index.
- Index number starts with *zero*.

### Multidimensional Arrays
- They are declared by more than one set of square brackets after the array variable name.
- For example, a 2D array would be declared as
```dataType arrayName [#rows][#columns];```

## Strings
```C
char string1[10] = {'P', 'r', 'o', 'g', 'r', 'a', 'm', '\0'};
char string2[10] = "Program";
```
- These are character arrays with special null character '\0' at the end of the string.
- Enough array storage should be already allocated to accommodate the largest string in use.
- Failing to end a string with ‘\0’ can lead to error in interpreting strings.
- To initialize a string, enclose the string literal in double-quotes, eg: “Program”.
- In a string, individual characters can also be accessed using index.
- The format specifiers for strings are-
  - Without blank spaces: %s
  - With blank spaces: %[^\n]s

## Pointers
|Operator|Description|Example|
|:------:|:------|:-----|
|&|Returns the address of a variable.|&a; returns the actual address of the variable.|
|\*|Pointer to a variable.|int \*a; is an integer pointer called a to an integer variable.|
